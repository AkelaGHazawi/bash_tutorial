# 2. Edit text files

Please use *cd ..* to go back to the top directory of the tutorial material. Then, change to the directory *exercise_2*.

## 2.1. See what is in a text file
In the directory *exercise_2/*, you will find a text file *solution_2.1.txt*. The **fifth character** is inside that file. To see its contents, use the command

    more <filename>

## 2.2. Edit text files
To get **character number six**, you will need to create a text file in the *exercise_2* directory. On Ubuntu, you can do this using the editor *gedit*. You can start it typing the name of the program, or 

    gedit <filename>

Create a text file with a name of your choice in the *exercise_2* directory that contains the phrase 

    Please give me solution 2.2

Afterwards, run the program 

    ./text_file_check

#### Hint
If you want to know more about a particular command, type
